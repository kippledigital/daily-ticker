# Resend Production Access & Deliverability Guide

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Email System Working:** Successfully sending to `brief@dailyticker.co`
‚úÖ **Domain Verified:** All DNS records (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) verified
‚ùå **Sandbox Mode Active:** Can only send to `brief@dailyticker.co`
‚ö†Ô∏è **Deliverability Issue:** Emails going to spam (normal for new domains)

---

## Issue 1: Sandbox Mode (CRITICAL - Blocks External Sends)

**Problem:** Resend only allows sending to `brief@dailyticker.co` in sandbox mode.

**Error Message:**
```
"You can only send testing emails to your own email address (brief@dailyticker.co).
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains,
and change the `from` address to an email using this domain."
```

### Solution: Request Production Access

#### Option A: Check API Key Type (Fastest)
1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Check if your current key says "Test" or "Development"
3. If so, create a new **Production API Key**
4. Update in Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel env add RESEND_API_KEY production
   # Paste the new production key
   ```
5. Redeploy and test

#### Option B: Request Production Access
1. Go to https://resend.com/overview or https://resend.com/settings
2. Look for banner saying "Sandbox Mode" or "Testing Mode"
3. Click "Request Production Access" or "Upgrade Account"
4. Fill out the form:
   - **Use case:** Newsletter/Marketing emails for financial market analysis
   - **Sending volume:** ~100-500 emails per day
   - **Domain:** dailyticker.co
   - **Purpose:** Daily stock market brief for subscribers
5. Submit and wait for approval (usually instant to a few hours)

#### Option C: Contact Resend Support
If you don't see either option above:
1. Go to https://resend.com/support
2. Email: support@resend.com
3. Subject: "Request Production Access for dailyticker.co"
4. Message:
   ```
   Hi Resend team,

   I've successfully verified my domain (dailyticker.co) with all DNS records
   (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) but I'm still in sandbox mode and can only send to my
   own domain email address.

   I'd like to request production access to send daily market analysis emails
   to my subscriber list (~100-500 recipients per day).

   Domain: dailyticker.co
   API Key: re_******** (last 8 characters of your key)

   Thank you!
   ```

## Issue 2: Spam Folder Deliverability (Not Blocking, Just Low Reputation)

**Problem:** Emails to `brief@dailyticker.co` are being delivered but landing in spam.

**Why This Happens:**
- Brand new domain with no sending history
- Low sender reputation (starts at 0, builds over time)
- Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook are cautious with new senders
- Email providers use reputation to filter spam

### Solution: Build Sender Reputation (Takes 2-4 Weeks)

#### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Warm Up Slowly**
   - Days 1-7: Send to 10-20 recipients per day
   - Days 8-14: Send to 50-100 recipients per day
   - Days 15+: Send to full list (500+)
   - This tells email providers you're legitimate

2. **Add SPF and DMARC Alignment Check**
   Go to https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx and check:
   ```
   SPF: dailyticker.co
   DMARC: dailyticker.co
   DKIM: resend._domainkey.dailyticker.co
   ```
   All should show ‚úÖ PASS

3. **Test Your Email Score**
   - Go to https://www.mail-tester.com/
   - Send test email to the provided address
   - Check your spam score (aim for 8+/10)
   - Fix any issues shown

4. **Authenticate with Google Postmaster**
   - Go to https://postmaster.google.com/
   - Add and verify `dailyticker.co`
   - Monitor spam rate and reputation over time

#### Content Improvements (Reduce Spam Triggers)

Update your emails to avoid spam filters:

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå ALL CAPS SUBJECT LINES
- ‚ùå Multiple exclamation marks!!!
- ‚ùå Spammy words: "FREE", "URGENT", "ACT NOW", "LIMITED TIME"
- ‚ùå Too many links (max 2-3 per email)
- ‚ùå Large images (keep images under 1MB total)
- ‚ùå Misleading subject lines

**Include:**
- ‚úÖ Plain text version (Resend auto-generates this)
- ‚úÖ Unsubscribe link (already implemented ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Physical mailing address in footer (consider adding)
- ‚úÖ Consistent FROM name and email
- ‚úÖ Personalization when possible

#### Week 1-2 Strategy

**Goal:** Get early subscribers to engage with emails

1. **Send Welcome Email to First 10 Subscribers**
   - Ask them to reply or click a link
   - Gmail tracks engagement - replies boost reputation significantly
   - Add to contacts or whitelist

2. **Send from Personal Email First (Optional)**
   - Week 1: Send daily brief from your personal Gmail/Outlook
   - Include: "Coming soon: Get this delivered automatically via Daily Ticker!"
   - This builds initial engagement before domain reputation matters

3. **Get Feedback from Test Users**
   - Send to 5-10 friends/colleagues first
   - Ask them to:
     - Check spam folder
     - Mark as "Not Spam" if there
     - Reply to the email
     - Click the archive link
   - These actions boost reputation

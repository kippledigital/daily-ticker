## Engagement Response Templates

### For Genuine Questions

Great question! That's exactly what we cover in the daily brief - [specific detail they asked about].

Happy to answer follow-ups once you've checked it out 👍
```

### For Stock-Specific Questions
```
We share high-level analysis on Twitter, but entry prices and risk management are in the full brief.

We do this to encourage responsible investing (not just chasing tickers).

```

### For Complaints About Withholding Info
```
We get it! Here's our thinking:

Twitter = tickers + direction (what to watch)
Email = full analysis + entry zones (how to act)

This way you get value either way, but the brief gives you actionable details.

## Red Flags & When to Pause

### Stop Posting If:
- [ ] Multiple picks are significantly wrong (>10% loss in a week)
- [ ] Getting hostile engagement or accusations
- [ ] Gumloop automation breaks (don't post incomplete data)
- [ ] Legal/compliance concerns arise

### In These Cases:
1. Pause daily posts
2. Post transparency update
3. Fix underlying issue
4. Resume with explanation

### Example Pause Message:
```
Hitting pause on daily picks this week while we refine our methodology.

We had 2 misses last week and want to ensure we're providing the quality analysis you expect.

Current subscribers: You'll get an update email tomorrow with details.

Back Monday with improvements 🔧

**Decision-making framework:**
When in doubt, ask:

2. Does this provide value?
3. Does this align with our mission (clear, actionable, human)?

If yes to all three, do it.

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

If you're overwhelmed, start with these 5 things:

1. [ ] Set up the Gumloop Twitter summary field
2. [ ] Create the analytics tracking sheet
3. [ ] Write 7 days of tweets using the Primary Format
4. [ ] Set a daily 8 AM alarm
5. [ ] Post your first tweet tomorrow

Everything else can be optimized as you go.

**The most important thing is consistency.**

Better to post a simple tweet every day than to post a perfect tweet once a week.

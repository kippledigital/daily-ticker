## The Strategy in One Paragraph

Daily Ticker will post a daily "watchlist" tweet at 8 AM EST featuring 3 stocks with their action (BUY/WATCH/HOLD), confidence score, and a 5-7 word summary. This provides enough value to build authority and trust while withholding detailed analysis (entry prices, risk management, allocation guidance) to create a curiosity gap that drives email signups. The strategy balances transparency (confidence scores), actionability (clear direction), and scarcity of detail (motivation to subscribe).

---

## Quick Start (5 Steps)

If you want to launch this week:

1. **Read:** `product-manager-output.md` (30 minutes)
2. **Set up tracking:** Create Google Sheets with template from `twitter-implementation-checklist.md` (15 minutes)
3. **Configure Gumloop:** Add Twitter summary field using `gumloop-twitter-integration-spec.md` (2-3 hours)
4. **Write first week:** Use templates from `twitter-content-strategy.md` to write 7 tweets (1 hour)
5. **Launch:** Post first tweet Monday at 8 AM EST

**Total time to launch:** 5-6 hours of focused work

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Tweet Format
**Chosen:** "Daily 3" format (all 3 stocks in one tweet)

**Why:** Shows thoroughness, provides multiple engagement opportunities, doesn't feel artificially scarce. Scarcity is in the DETAIL, not quantity.

### Decision 2: Information Shared
**Share:** Ticker, action, confidence score, 5-7 word summary
**Withhold:** Entry prices, detailed analysis, risk management, allocation %

**Why:** Builds authority while creating clear motivation to subscribe for actionable details.

### Decision 3: Posting Schedule
**Chosen:** Daily at 8:00 AM EST (Mon-Fri)

**Why:** Consistent pre-market timing when FinTwit audience is most active and receptive.

### Decision 4: Automation Timing
**Chosen:** Manual for first 30 days, then automate

**Why:** Learn what works before locking in automation. Enables rapid iteration.

### Decision 5: Content Mix
**Chosen:** 70% stock picks, 15% education, 10% performance, 5% engagement

**Why:** Core value is picks, but education builds trust and performance provides social proof.

## What Makes This Different

Most stock-picking Twitter accounts either:
1. Give away everything (no conversion)
2. Post pure clickbait (no trust)
3. Use too much jargon (lose casual investors)

**Daily Ticker's approach:**
- **Transparent:** Show confidence scores and methodology
- **Actionable:** Clear BUY/WATCH/HOLD direction
- **Accessible:** Plain English, no jargon
- **Strategic:** Enough value to build trust, enough withholding to drive conversions
- **Design-First:** Beautiful, scannable format

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Giving away too much
**Mitigation:** Strict adherence to "share vs withhold" framework. No entry prices, no detailed analysis on Twitter.

### Risk 2: Not enough value to build credibility
**Mitigation:** Confidence scores show rigor, weekly performance tracking shows accountability.

### Risk 3: Picks go wrong and hurt reputation
**Mitigation:** Transparent communication, educational framing, clear disclaimers, performance tracking shows long-term accuracy.

### Risk 4: Inconsistent posting
**Mitigation:** Gumloop automation, daily reminders, Week 1 content pre-written.

## FAQs

### Q: How much time does this take daily?
**A:** 30 minutes in manual phase (15 min morning prep, 15 min engagement/logging). Reduces to 10 min once automated.

### Q: What if our picks are wrong?
**A:** The strategy includes crisis management templates. Key is transparency and educational framing. Weekly performance tracking shows long-term accuracy.

### Q: Can we test this without full Gumloop integration?
**A:** Yes! Start with manual tweet creation using templates. Gumloop optimization can come later.

### Q: How do we know if it's working?
**A:** Track email signups with UTM parameters. Target: 15-25% of Twitter traffic converts to email. If lower, adjust CTA. If higher, potentially giving away too little value.

### Q: What if we don't hit the targets?
**A:** First 30 days is learning phase. Use A/B tests to optimize. Most critical metric is consistency - showing up daily builds audience regardless of early conversion numbers.

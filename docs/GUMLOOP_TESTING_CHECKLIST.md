- [ ] `response_status` = `"201"` (success)
- [ ] `success` = `"true"`
- [ ] `response_body` contains success message
- [ ] No error messages in logs

**If Node 20 fails, check:**
- Error message in `response_body`
- Verify date format is YYYY-MM-DD
- Confirm all required fields are present
- Check Vercel function logs for details

### Step 4: Verify Email Was Sent
- [ ] Check nikki.kipple@gmail.com inbox
- [ ] Morning Brief email received
- [ ] Email content looks correct
- [ ] Subject line matches Node 20's `subject` value

### Step 5: Verify Archive Updated
- [ ] Visit https://dailyticker.co/archive
- [ ] Brief appears in the list
- [ ] Date shows today's date
- [ ] Subject line matches email
- [ ] Click on the brief card

### Step 6: Verify Individual Brief Page
- [ ] URL is https://dailyticker.co/archive/YYYY-MM-DD (today's date)
- [ ] Page loads successfully
- [ ] Subject line displays correctly
- [ ] TL;DR summary is visible
- [ ] Stock summary cards show all stocks from analysis
- [ ] Each stock card shows:
  - Ticker, sector, confidence %
  - Risk level badge (color-coded)
  - Action badge (BUY/WATCH/HOLD/AVOID)
  - Entry price and zone
  - All recommendation details
- [ ] Social sharing buttons work
- [ ] Subscribe CTA visible at bottom

## üîÅ Test Run #2: Next Day Test

### Purpose
Verify historical data (Node 7b) works correctly when there's data from previous day.

### Steps
- [ ] Wait 24 hours OR manually run automation again with different stocks
- [ ] Node 7b should now return yesterday's brief in the array
- [ ] Check Stock Analysis AI prompt includes historical context
- [ ] Verify new brief doesn't repeat yesterday's stocks (unless legitimately trending)
- [ ] New brief appears in archive
- [ ] Archive now shows 2 briefs, sorted newest first

---

## üîç Verification Checklist

### Database Storage
- [ ] Briefs are being saved to Vercel KV (check Vercel Storage metrics)
- [ ] Storage usage is increasing (see Vercel dashboard)
- [ ] No duplicate date errors (each day should be unique)

### Historical Data Usage
- [ ] Stock Analysis AI references past recommendations
- [ ] TL;DR mentions trending patterns when applicable
- [ ] Subject lines reference recent winners when relevant
- [ ] No exact duplicate stock recommendations within 7 days (unless intentional)

### Error Handling
- [ ] If Node 20 fails, email still sends (workflow continues)
- [ ] Errors are logged but don't block daily operation
- [ ] Failed briefs don't appear in archive (expected)

### Google Sheets Comparison
- [ ] Compare data saved in Google Sheets vs database
- [ ] Verify all fields are captured correctly
- [ ] Confirm no data loss during migration
- [ ] Once verified, Google Sheets nodes can be removed

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All of these should be true before removing Google Sheets:

- [ ] **3 consecutive days** of successful automation runs
- [ ] **3 briefs** appear in archive (https://dailyticker.co/archive)
- [ ] **Historical data** is being used in stock analysis (verify in email content)
- [ ] **No errors** in Gumloop Node 20 logs
- [ ] **Email delivery** continues uninterrupted
- [ ] **Archive pages** load correctly for all 3 briefs
- [ ] **Search functionality** works (search by ticker from any brief)
- [ ] **Data completeness** matches Google Sheets entries

---

## üóëÔ∏è Remove Google Sheets (After Success)

Once all tests pass for 3 consecutive days:

### Nodes to Remove:
1. **Node kVpKrp5keKFeucu9HsF1Yk** - Google Sheets Reader
2. **Node 3ZJKf14g5WDntfbDexenNP** - Google Sheets Writer

### Steps:
1. Take a final backup export from Google Sheets (download as CSV)
2. In Gumloop, delete the two Google Sheets nodes
3. Verify no broken connections in the workflow
4. Run one more test to confirm workflow still works
5. Archive or delete the Google Sheet (keep as backup for 30 days)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Node 20 Returns 400 Error
**Possible Causes:**
- Missing required fields (date, subject, htmlContent, stocks)
- Invalid date format (must be YYYY-MM-DD)
- stocks array is empty or malformed
- Missing stock fields (ticker, sector, confidence, etc.)

**Solution:**
- Check Gumloop's Node 20 input mapping
- Verify each field is connected correctly
- Check Vercel function logs for detailed error message

### Node 20 Returns 409 Error
**Cause:** Duplicate brief for same date (already exists)

**Solution:**
- Brief was already saved (check archive)
- If testing, delete previous test brief from KV
- If real duplicate, investigate why automation ran twice

### Node 20 Returns 500 Error
**Possible Causes:**
- Vercel KV database connection issue
- Environment variables not set
- Function timeout or error

**Solution:**
- Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Status
- Verify KV environment variables are set
- Check Vercel function logs for stack trace

### Node 7b Returns Empty Array
**First Run:** This is normal - no historical data yet

**After First Run:**
- Check Vercel KV has data: `curl https://dailyticker.co/api/archive/list`
- Verify Node 20 successfully saved previous brief
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

### Brief Doesn't Appear in Archive
**Check:**
1. Node 20 returned 201 status (success)
2. Visit archive API directly: https://dailyticker.co/api/archive/list
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors
4. Verify date format in Node 20 output

### Email Sends But Database Doesn't Save
**This is OK!** Error handling is working correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Check Node 20 error message in Gumloop logs
2. Fix the issue (likely field mapping or format)
3. Run automation again
4. Previous email recipients won't be affected

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. **Remove Google Sheets** (nodes kVpKrp5keKFeucu9HsF1Yk and 3ZJKf14g5WDntfbDexenNP)
2. **Schedule daily automation** (if not already scheduled for 6am)
3. **Monitor for 1 week** to ensure stability
4. **Share archive link** with subscribers
5. **Plan Phase 2:** Performance tracking (win rates, % gains)

# Case Study Notes: Building Daily Ticker

*Personal notes for Twitter/case study - what I'm actually building*

---

Hey, so I'm working on this random project in my spare time and honestly? It's starting to feel like a real thing? Maybe? I'm not really sure what I'm doing - I'm just learning as I go, figuring it out one bug at a time.

## How This Actually Started

It wasn't about wanting to learn investing. I mean, I have a 401k and zero understanding of how it works, but that's not really the point.

The real question was: can I give myself an unfair advantage? Is there something I can build myself to maybe make some money?

Investing was one way to do that, but I'm not that interested in day trading or stocks themselves. (Probably not a great business plan to say I'm not that interested in stocks, but here I am.)

The interesting part isn't Daily Ticker or the stocks - it's the building part. The automation part. Taking an idea that would be helpful for me (I am the target audience) and building myself something that would benefit me.

Started simple: send myself daily emails. Maybe texts. Something to help me figure out how to make these investments so I can benefit.

Haven't even gotten to the point where I get to take the advice of my own briefs because I'm still so deep in the process of building it.

## The Journey from No-Code to... This

I've played around with automation tools before. Zapier, Make, n8n, Airtable, Relevance AI. Tried building Twitter bots, weird automated accounts, seeing if I could gain traction. Never really had much success.

Got to a point where I just... didn't like those tools anymore. The nodes, how everything connects, the code you don't know is inside them. Just wasn't working for my brain.

Then I realized through vibe coding (essentially) that I could build my own thing. Build my own n8n, I guess. Just root code. That connection was really interesting - starting to understand how the back end of things work. Which I guess is development.

I think I'm a systems thinker. That's probably a good way to describe my brain. I'm always breaking things down into where they keep going, and it keeps interesting me. So I keep going deeper into it.

## What I'm Actually Building

When I step back and look at what I've built, it's kind of wild as someone who has very little knowledge and understanding of what they're doing and learning as they go:

- **Automated email system** - Sends daily briefs to subscribers, handles segmentation, tracks opens
- **Multi-API data aggregation** - Pulls from Polygon.io, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, stitches it all together
- **AI-powered content generation** - Uses GPT-4o to analyze stocks and write the actual email content
- **Error handling and monitoring** - When things break, I get notified. When things work, I know about it.
- **Subscriber management** - People can sign up, upgrade to premium, unsubscribe, all that jazz

Like... this isn't just a side project anymore? I think? This feels like infrastructure. This feels like a product. But I'm not really sure what I'm doing, so who knows.

## The $20/Month Reality Check

I just upgraded to Vercel Pro because I kept hitting timeouts. $20/month feels like a lot for a "fun project" but I'm trying to tell myself it's worth it?

That's supposed to be infrastructure, right? That's:
- 15-minute execution windows (vs 5 minutes)
- Professional serverless functions (I think?)
- Reliable cron jobs
- Edge network performance

If this thing makes ANY money, $20/month is nothing. But I don't know if it will. It's the cost of... trying, I guess? Not sure if it's a hobby expense or a business expense yet.

(I'll stick that expense to the company credit card 😉)

## Learning As I Go

This whole thing is just... learning as I go. The debugging? Honestly, I'm just glad it's over. Reading logs, tracing errors, understanding how systems fit together - it was frustrating and I'm not sure if I was doing it "right," but I got through it.

For the first time, I understood where someone might think about hiring someone else to do it. That's a real thought that crossed my mind.

I'm not just copying tutorials anymore. I'm solving actual problems. Or at least trying to. Building something that might actually work, if I can figure out all the pieces. I'm just... learning as I go, one frustrating bug at a time.

## The Real Talk

I'm less confident about this whole thing. I'm just a product designer in the wild, seeing if I can make an idea into something functional without much experience as an entrepreneur.

I know people want this - I did the UX work, so I know that part. Will they pay for it? No idea. But I'm building something real, and that feels different than just "learning to code." It's learning by doing. Learning as I go.

The real question is: can you actually build something that works by itself and makes money with little investment? Is anyone else doing that? How far can I take it if I just keep trying things and learning through the process all by myself?

I'm worried or nervous to move past this phase of continuing to learn more about how to just get this up and rolling - building something that works by itself, that could potentially just make a bunch of money sort of on its own with very little investment. Could I actually make something like that?

## The Scary Part: Actually Telling People

Thinking about the marketing or social media aspect sort of makes me want to gag. So if I want to get sales on Daily Ticker, I have to start thinking about a plan that feels comfortable and will work to get users to the site.

I'm feeling like it's almost there and it's almost ready to go, and I'm hesitant to get into the next part. Maybe that starts with me sharing some of my process on Twitter, on my personal Twitter, and then seeing if anyone finds me.

I have no plan, I guess, is where I'm at in terms of this project. I'm just right now, here, at this point where I built this thing, and I'm feeling pretty good about it, and like that other people could probably benefit from it. But then I also am thinking about how I don't know if I want to put myself out there.

Anyone else out there just... trying to figure it out?

---

## Step 1: Run Database Schema (2 minutes)

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/dmnbqxbddtdfndvanxyv

2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

3. Click **New Query**

4. Copy the entire contents of `/supabase/subscribers-schema.sql`

5. Paste into the query editor

6. Click **Run** (bottom right)

7. Verify success:
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - Go to **Table Editor** â†’ you should see:
     - `subscribers` table
     - `email_events` table

---

## Step 2: Verify Tables Created (1 minute)

Run this query to verify:

```sql
-- Check subscribers table
SELECT * FROM subscribers LIMIT 1;

-- Check email_events table
SELECT * FROM email_events LIMIT 1;

-- Check analytics view
SELECT * FROM subscriber_stats;
```

Expected result: Empty tables (no rows), but no errors.

---

## Step 3: Test Subscribe Endpoint (2 minutes)

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test subscribe
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/subscribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"message":"Successfully subscribed!"}

# Verify in Supabase
# Go to Table Editor â†’ subscribers â†’ you should see test@example.com
```

### Production Testing

```bash
# Test subscribe
curl -X POST "https://daily-ticker.vercel.app/api/subscribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your@email.com"}'
```

---

## Step 4: Test Unsubscribe Endpoint (2 minutes)

### Via API

```bash
# Test unsubscribe
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/unsubscribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"message":"Successfully unsubscribed. We're sorry to see you go!","email":"test@example.com"}
```

### Via UI

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/unsubscribe
2. Enter `test@example.com`
3. Click **Unsubscribe**
4. Should see success message

---

## Step 5: Verify Email Sending (3 minutes)

```bash
# Test email sending
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/test/send-email?email=your@email.com"

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"message":"Test email sent successfully to your@email.com"}

# Check your inbox (might be in spam for onboarding@resend.dev)
```

**Note:** Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` often go to spam. To fix:
- Verify custom domain in Resend (https://resend.com/domains)
- Set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL='Daily Ticker <brief@dailyticker.co>'`

---

## Step 6: Update Environment Variables (2 minutes)

### Remove Beehiiv Variables

~~BEEHIIV_API_KEY~~
~~BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID~~

### Keep These Variables

```bash
# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://dmnbqxbddtdfndvanxyv.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...

# Resend (already configured)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_j2nS8J2y_...

# Optional: Custom domain email
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL='Daily Ticker <brief@dailyticker.co>'
```

### Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to https://vercel.com/kippledigital/daily-ticker/settings/environment-variables
2. **Delete:** `BEEHIIV_API_KEY`, `BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID`
3. **Keep:** All Supabase and Resend variables
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

## SQL Queries for Analytics

### Total Active Subscribers
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscribers WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Subscriber Growth (Last 30 Days)
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(subscribed_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as new_subscribers
FROM subscribers
WHERE subscribed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(subscribed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Top Performing Emails (Highest Open Rate)
```sql
SELECT
  email,
  emails_sent,
  emails_opened,
  ROUND((emails_opened::DECIMAL / NULLIF(emails_sent, 0) * 100), 1) as open_rate_percent
FROM subscribers
WHERE emails_sent > 0
ORDER BY open_rate_percent DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Unsubscribe Rate
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'unsubscribed') as unsubscribed,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND((COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'unsubscribed')::DECIMAL / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0) * 100), 2) as unsubscribe_rate_percent
FROM subscribers;
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] Subscribe form works (website)
- [ ] Unsubscribe link works (email footer)
- [ ] Unsubscribe page UI works
- [ ] Duplicate email handling works (reactivate if unsubscribed)
- [ ] Email sending fetches from Supabase correctly
- [ ] `emails_sent` counter increments after sending
- [ ] Analytics views return data
- [ ] Resend dashboard shows email analytics
- [ ] Environment variables removed: BEEHIIV_API_KEY, BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID

## Troubleshooting

### "Email not found in subscriber list" when unsubscribing

**Cause:** Email doesn't exist in database
**Fix:** Check spelling, verify email exists in Supabase

### Subscribe returns "Failed to subscribe"

**Cause:** Supabase client not initialized or table doesn't exist
**Fix:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
2. Run the schema SQL in Supabase dashboard

### Email sent count not incrementing

**Cause:** Postgres function `increment_emails_sent` not created
**Fix:** Re-run the schema SQL, specifically the function definition

### Emails going to spam

**Cause:** Using `onboarding@resend.dev` sender address
**Fix:**
1. Verify custom domain in Resend
2. Set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL='Daily Ticker <brief@dailyticker.co>'`

# DailyTicker Economics - Quick Summary
**TL;DR: You've built a 95% margin business that's profitable from subscriber #1**

## Current Monthly Costs

### What You're Actually Paying Right Now
- **Domain:** $1/month
- **AI (GPT-4 Turbo):** $2.86/month
- **Everything else:** $0/month (free tiers)
- **TOTAL:** **$3.86/month**

### Vercel Compliance Issue ⚠️
- You're on Hobby (free) tier, which is "non-commercial use only"
- You're running a paid subscription business

## Break-Even Math

### Current Setup (Free Tier)
- **Break-even:** 1 subscriber ($96/year revenue > $46/year costs)
- You're profitable from day 1!

### Compliant Setup (Vercel Pro)
- **Break-even:** 3-4 subscribers ($288-384/year revenue > $286/year costs)
- Still incredibly low barrier to profitability

## Unit Economics (The Good Stuff)

### Cost per Subscriber at Scale
| Subscribers | Cost/Sub/Year | Revenue/Sub | Profit/Sub | Margin |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|--------|

| 500 | $5.35 | $96 | $90.65 | 94% |
| 1,000 | $4.53 | $96 | $91.47 | 95% |

### What This Means
- **Variable cost per user:** $0.012/month (1.2 cents!)
- **At 100+ subscribers:** You keep $90+ per subscriber per year
- **This is a 95% margin business at scale**

## The Critical Insight

**Your biggest cost is NOT infrastructure - it's customer acquisition.**

### CAC Math
- If you spend $50 to acquire a subscriber, you profit $46 in year 1
- If you spend $80 to acquire a subscriber, you profit $16 in year 1
- **Break-even CAC:** ~$90 (payback in year 1)

### LTV Math (assuming 2-year average lifetime)
- **LTV:** $192 (2 years × $96)
- **Cost to serve:** $10 (2 × $5/year)
- **Payment processing:** $7 (2 × $3.56)
- **Net LTV:** $175

**You can afford to spend $100-150 on acquisition and still be profitable!**

## What You Should Focus On

### ❌ Don't Focus On:
- Reducing infrastructure costs (already at minimum)
- Optimizing API usage (saves pennies)
- Complex scaling architecture (premature)

### ✅ Do Focus On:
1. **Getting 10 paying subscribers** (proves product-market fit)
2. **Content quality** (drives retention and referrals)
3. **Acquisition channels** (Reddit, Twitter, finance communities)
4. **Referral program** (each referral costs $10-20 in credits but brings $96 in revenue)
5. **Retention** (keep churn under 30% annually)
